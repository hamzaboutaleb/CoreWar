# CoreWar Game

## Overview

CoreWar is a programming game originally conceived by D. G. Jones in 1984. The game draws inspiration from the way computer viruses attempt to take over a system's memory. Players write programs, called "warriors," that compete for control of a virtual computer.

From its inception, CoreWar gained a passionate following, with a vibrant community that introduced new features and organized tournaments around the world. The game has become a classic example of competitive programming and artificial life simulation.

## Project Goal

This project aims to recreate the essential tools and environment needed to run a modern, more elaborate version of the CoreWar game. The implementation will allow users to:

- Write and submit their own warriors (programs)
- Simulate battles between warriors in a virtual memory arena
- Analyze and visualize the results of these battles

## Features

- **Warrior Programming:** Write warriors in a supported assembly-like language.
- **Battle Simulator:** Run matches between warriors, simulating their actions in a shared memory space.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` or below to set up the environment.
3. Write your own warrior or use sample warriors provided.
4. Run battles and enjoy the game!
